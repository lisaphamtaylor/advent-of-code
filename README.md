lisaphamtaylor's Advent of Code solutions

Hi, I am using Advent of Code to help me improve my software development skills and understanding. I am using Python to solve the problems in the Advent Calendar of Code. 2023 is my first year checking this out, so I am sure there are better ways to do things. I am open to suggestions and feedback. I am also open to collaboration.
